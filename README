Plasti is a 2-D ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) code donated to
CIG by Sean Willett and Chris Fuller of the University of
Washington. The code originated at Dalhousie University in Canada.

The code is described in greater detail in the paper

  Fuller, C.W., Willett, S.D. and Brandon, M.T., 2006. Formation of
  forearc basins and their influence on subduction zone
  earthquakes. Geology, 34: 65-68.

To compile Plasti, you need a Fortran 90 compiler and lapack and blas
implementations.  The makefile is set up to compile with gfortran, so
you may have to modify it if you want to use a different compiler.
gfortan gives a number of warnings, but should compile fine.
